# Employee-Tracker

## Description 

This application was built in order to manage and add employee data into a database. This provides organisation and ease of viewing all the employees apart of the companies, detailing their name, id, salaries and departments.
This prevents chaos, and keeps the company organised.
I learnt how to use schema, sql commands, inquirer.

## Installation

This application uses node.js, inquirer, console table and mysql2. Start by entering npm start in the cmd/powershell terminal. To view the database from MySQL run run mysql -u root -p.

## Usage
This application is used to view, add employees into roles and departments.
